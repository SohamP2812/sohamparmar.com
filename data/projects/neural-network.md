## Description

A deep neural network model with one hidden layer that can classify digits from 0-9 (MNIST Dataset). Has an input layer of 784 nodes corresponding to each pixel. Has one hidden layer with 10 nodes, with each node being backwardly connected to each node of the input layer. Has a 10 node output layer with each node corresponding to a digit between 0-9.
