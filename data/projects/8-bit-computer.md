## Description

Created an 8-bit computer from scratch over the summer! Not simulated and completely designed on a breadboard. Used logic gates and other integrated circuits, complete with registers, RAM/ROM, 7-segment displays, binary counters, CPU clock (max 500Hz), Arithmetic Logic Unit. Designed computer to be programmable through DIP-switches and LEDs. The LEDs are used for binary values and control values within the computer. Also incorporated a 4-digit, 7-segment display used for displaying numeric values from 0 to 255 or -127 to +127. The programs are entered as a series of 8-bit commands consisting of a 4-bit operation and 4-bit operand.
