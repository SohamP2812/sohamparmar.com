## Description

Peak brings fair, free-to-play video game tournaments to everyone. It is a startup founded by me and a close friend after we realized there is a gap in the ESports market in consideration of the competitive aspect of amatuer gaming. We aim to offer casual gamers an opportunity to display their skills in competition with similarly skilled players for a chance of winning cash prizes and advancement into major tournaments.
