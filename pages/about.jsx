              I am a 1st year undergraduate student at the University of
              Waterloo. I am currently a candidate for a Bachelor's in Applied
              Sciences with a major in Computer Engineering.

              My name is Soham. I am 18 and currently attend Post-Secondary at
              the University of Waterloo. My passions range from a wide variety
              of interests, but most significantly focus on ideas in science,
              engineering and business.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              I come from an ‚ÄúIndo-Canadian‚Äù cultural background. My dad was
              born in Canada and is a first generation Indo-Canadian and my mom
              was born in India. This combination of western and Indian cultures
              has given me the best of both worlds. I enjoy the diverse Indian
              and the Canadian cuisines, and my vacationing experiences in
              different parts of India and Canada have made me appreciate the
              cultures of both worlds.

              I tend to be very curious by nature, which means I can‚Äôt easily do
              nothing productive in my time. What I mean by this is I try to
              have something to do and put my mind towards whenever I have free
              time. Usually this thing is something of a hobby, or some goal I
              have set. More recently these have actually been related to
              engineering, on the computer side of things. For example, I enjoy
              tinkering with a Raspberry Pi that I have. I use this to practice
              my programming and practical experience.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              I really love the game of basketball üèÄ. Be it watching the NBA,
              playing a pick-up game or just shooting around ‚Äì I fully enjoy it.
              There is something gratifying about putting down your books,
              clearing your mind, and just dedicating yourself to the game. I‚Äôve
              never been a superb player, nor have I been on a competitive team;
              nevertheless, I always gain an unmatched sense of freedom from
              playing, no matter how well I play. Arguably one of the most
              exciting parts of playing basketball is being able to play with my
              friends. It provides me with a way to connect with others
              actively, and all you need is each other, a ball, and a hoop. Even
              with such fruitful emotions, I can never pinpoint exactly what the
              manner is by which I achieve such joy. Is it the dynamic gameplay,
              the absence of stress, the sense of belonging? I don‚Äôt know, but
              regardless, this feeling is untouched by anything else.
