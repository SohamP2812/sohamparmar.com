    React the optimal choice for web development for myself - but it is not 
    without flaws on its own. A lot of features come out of the box with 
    Next.js that you would normally have to manually configure - such as 
    server side rendering, JS bundling, routing, and more. I would much rather 
    use a framework like Next.js to enjoy complex features like that with little

    is very crucial to the feel of the website as well as my sanity for when 
    I completed the site. I knew from the jump that I did not want to just use 
    raw CSS - primarily because I wanted to challenge myself to use new tools 
    and make the burden of styling easier. I had a goal in mind when selecting 
    Tailwind CSS, and that was to avoid unnecessary complexity. I decided against 
    using any preprocessor like Sass since it would likely be too overkill for 
    this. I ended up deciding upon Tailwind just because of how easy it is to 
    style components right in jsx files and how simple breakpoint changes are to 
    implement. I also used Mui for premade components that I have little interest 
    in creating manually - such as the accordion you are reading from right now :)`,

    for this web app, given that it fell in line with my principle of little 
    configuration. Seeing that Vercel is the creator and maintainer of Next.js, it is 
    evident that deploying a Next.js app on a serverless Vercel service would be simple. 
    Vercel is akin to App Engine for GCP and Elastic Beanstalk for AWS. Moreover, Vercel 
    offers out-of-the-box CI/CD with automatic deployment in response to GitHub pushes.`,

    changes to the site as time goes on, it is crucial that there is a robust VCS that exists 
    as a backbone for the project. Moreover, the integration with Vercel for automatic 
    deployments streamlines work significantly.`,

              Whether you are enthusiastic about software development or not - I
              believe a personal website is a powerful tool to show off your
              skills and accomplishments to the anyone who is interested and may
              be willing to connect with you. Having an online presence in the
              digital age is a must in my opinion.

            <p>
              Early 2020, I attempted my first shot at making a personal
              portfolio website. I used my knowledge of React and barebones CSS
              to make a static website which I could use to begin my online
              presence professionally.
